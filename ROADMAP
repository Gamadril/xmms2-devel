Between every minor release there vill be micro relases that fixes bugs.

XMMS 1.94.0 "A big piece of garbage": 

This should be a complete mpg123-killer. Usable for everyday popping.

* Better console interface
* Resampler
* mad and vorbis plugins should be compleated.
* libxmmsclient
* Specification of LibL44T

XMMS 1.95.0 "Birbot of IceCatraz":

First release to the public.

* Mixer / Seek / Stop all things needed for next step.
* Plugin API freeze.
* Documentation!
* Medialibtool and interaction with clients.
* First slow steps on libl44t.

XMMS 1.96.0 "That's Lobstertainment!"

All plugins should be done here, see TODO file for more info.

* Plugins, plugins and more plugins.
* First Win32 binary (???)

XMMS 1.97.0 "Space Pilot 3000"

At this point console player and core should be pretty stabilized. Now we
hit people with some elite libl44t alpha interface ;)

* First buggy, graphical interface.
* Probably tons of changes to plugins.

XMMS 1.98.0 "War is the H-Word"

XMMS 1.99.0 "A Bicyclops Built For Two"

XMMS 2.0.0 "Insane in the Mainframe"

Here we probably have a pretty stable version with GUI and all.
