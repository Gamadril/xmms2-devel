Another Pathetic And Naive Audio Player (APANAP)

Pathetic Application Delivering Digital Audio (PADDA)

X Music Multiplexing System (XMMS)

This is the new generation of the XMMS player
There are a lot of questions about the reason of XMMS2 and the
design goals. I will try to clearify them.

Q: Why rewrite XMMS?
A: XMMS is a old project (started in -97) and was not aimed to be as popular
as it became. The internal design of XMMS is somewhat ... troublesome. Also
the frameworks around XMMS has changed a lot. The general feeling among the
developers was that if ANYTHING would happen it should be a complete
rewrite.

Q: Who is responsible for XMMS2?
A: Peter Alm (original author for XMMS) did the first design and the initial
code. Most of the code is written by Tobias Rundström and Anders Gustafsson.
The project is beeing maintained by Tobias and Anders. A big thanks goes out
to Thomas "Fatal" Nilsson too, he bitches good.

Q: Thats not the same developers that maintain XMMS?
A: No that's true. This is a seperate project. Rest assure, XMMS will live
on for a long long time. XMMS2 is not in years ready to take over for XMMS.

Q: What are the design goals of XMMS2?
A: XMMS2 is designed to be a kickass music-player. We wanted to  rectify a few 
problems with the XMMS API's. For example the split of Inputplugin into Transport 
and Decoder. We also wanted the UI to be separated from the main engine in
order to allow other widgetsets then GTK+.

Q: Why just a musicplayer?
A: Lot of people ask us about video. But video will not be included nor
supported in XMMS2. This path has numerous reasons. Music and video are
highly seperate things, we belive that we can make the best musicplayer out
there but not the best videoplayer, so we stick to what we are best at.

Q: But XMMS stands for X MultiMedia System That includes video!
A: That is wrong in XMMS2, XMMS stands for X(cross)platform Music 
Multiplexing System.

Q: Seems like you are using a non-standard buildsystem, why not make?
A: make is a really good buildsystem, although to get all functionallity 
needed for a bigger project you'll need automake, autoconf and libtool. We
had a lot of problem getting this tools to do what we wanted, so we
evaluated the alternatives. SCons is a good alternative. If you do not want
to install python and SCons on your system, there will be binaries availible
for most platforms.

Q: And you are using BitKeeper as SCM? It's non-free software!!
A: Yeah, you will be able to download daily snapshots and patches from our
webpage if you can't use BK. We will not switch SCM, EOD.

Q: What platforms will you support?
A: Our aim is to be able to port it basicly everywhere, but development is 
concentrated around Linux-x86, Linux-PPC and MacOSX. Support for other
platforms is secondary. 

Q: What about Windows?
A: Our code should run on Windows without an problem. The showstopper is
that D-BUS is not ported to Windows yet, since XMMS2 is heavily based around
this lib we have to wait, or you can port it!

Common questions about usage:

Q: How do I use XMMS2?
A: XMMS2 is based around a server-client model, where all the logic resides
inside XMMS2D. With a client you can send commands to the daemon and play
the music. For now we only have a textmode cli client. To install, read the
INSTALL file. For usage of xmms2 cli client see the included manpage.

Q: What clients are in progress?
A: We probably will have a offical client based on somekind of
skinned-widget library that are still in development (libl44t, questions
about this is directed to andersg@xmms.org). Other people are working on a
GTK+ client and a E17 client (enlightenment). 

Q: When will XMMS2 be released for public consumption?
A: We don't know. When it's done. RSN.

Q: How do I get in contact with you guys?
A: E-Mail: tru@xmms.org and andersg@xmms.org
   IRC: debian.as:6667 #xmms2
